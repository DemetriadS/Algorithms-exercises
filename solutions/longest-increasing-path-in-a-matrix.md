# Problem restatement in your own words

We are given a matrix that is represented by an array. The array being: [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]].
We need to return the longest incresing path in the matrix.
We can store in an array the length of the longets path.
Every cell can be moved up, down, right, left.
We need to iterate throguh all cells, computing all paths and finding the maximum path.
It can't move diagonally and it can't move outside boundaries.

# Detailed step-by-step solution outline and complexity analysis

1. Define the matrix dimensions (rowsLength and colsLength).
   Create a storedArray to save already computed results.
   Define directions as the possible moves (up, down, left, right).
   We are using the memoization priciple to store the length of the longest increasing path starting from each cell.

2. - Write a helper function, `searchPath(row, col)`, to compute the longest increasing path starting from (row, col).
   - If the result for the current cell is already stored in storedArray, return it.
   - Initialize the maxPath as 1 for the current cell.
   - We can do in 4 dirrections represented by the direction vectors: `[[-1,0],[1,0],[0,-1],[0,1]]`
     For each of the four possible directions:
     - Calculate the new cellâ€™s coordinates.
     - Check if the move stays within bounds and if the value of the new cell is greater than the current cell.
     - If valid, compute the longest path from the new cell and update maxPath.
   - Store the computed maxPath for the current cell in storedArray and return it.
3. Iterate Over All Cells:

   - For each cell in the matrix, compute the longest increasing path starting from that cell using searchPath.
   - Keep track of the global maximum longestPath.

4. Return the Result - The result is the longest path found across all starting cells.

5. Complexity analysis
   - Each cell is processed once, and each recursive call checks up to 4 neighbors.
   - Using memoization ensures we do not process the same cell multiple times.
   - The total time spent on the searchPath function is proportional to O(m _ n), m being number of rows and n being number of columns, so the time complexity will be O(m _ n).
   - the space complexity i think it will be the same, O(m \* n) since we need space for each call.

# Final TypeScript solution code

```typescript
type Matrix = number[][];

function longestIncreasingPath(matrix: Matrix): number {
  const rowsLength = matrix.length;
  const colsLength = matrix[0].length;
  const directions = [
    [-1, 0],
    [1, 0],
    [0, -1],
    [0, 1],
  ];

  const storedArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < rowsLength; i++) {
    const row = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < colsLength; i++) {
      row.push(0);
    }
    storedArray.push(row);
  }
  const searchPath = (row, col) => {
    // If the value is already computed, return i
    if (storedArray[row][col] !== 0) return storedArray[row][col];
    let maxPath = 1;

    // Explore all four possible directions
    directions.forEach(([dx, dy]) => {
      const newRow = row + dx;
      const newCol = col + dy;

      if (
        newRow >= 0 &&
        newRow < rowsLength &&
        newCol >= 0 &&
        newCol < colsLength &&
        matrix[newRow][newCol] > matrix[row][col]
      ) {
        maxPath = Math.max(maxPath, 1 + searchPath(newRow, newCol));
      }
    });
    // Store the computed value and return it
    storedArray[row][col] = maxPath;
    return maxPath;
  };
  let longestPath = 0;

  // Compute the longest path starting from each cell
  for (let i = 0; i < rowsLength; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < colsLength; j++) {
      longestPath = Math.max(longestPath, searchPath(i, j));
    }
  }
  return longestPath;
}
```

# A short paragraph on challenges and optimizations

- Struggled with starting the problem. Did not know where the solution should start from in the matrix and how to wrap my head around moving in 4 directions. Started from a visual example on paper to illustrate how it is traversed.
- First i started only with a seach function that was receiving row and column and was calling it repeatedly for the same cells, this took to some failing tests based on performance problems and long time of execution. This took me to more research when i got to the concept of memoization and i had to get my head around it so that the algorithm would not repeat work for the same cells multiple times.
  By creating the stored array i ensured that each cell is calculated once.
- As a optimization:
  - refactor the code, by moving searchPath to a helper.
  - refactor by using Array.prototype solutions instead of the for loops
